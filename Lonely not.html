                <h3>Lonely Not</h3>
                <p>During this rather trying time of staying away from each other because of the corona virus we (that's almost everyone) have resorted ti technology... Ahhh! In some cases I have called the same person or should I say "face-timed" the same person several times in succession since I could not get rid of her picture on the I-pad. It would be much easier just to hang up the phone but I must say it was good to "see" her again. How do I yearb to be with and share my love with my children and grands. I miss them. I am a kivey, touchy, kissey-type person (no romance intended) and miss sharing my caring for the family and friends. However I do find many ways to enjoy my time alone. Now that the weather is nice and the flowers and trees are showing off their beauty, many neighbors are out walking so we shout, in a friendly way, to each other. It's interesting to see everyone in their natural state- no hair cuts and pretty hair-dos,natural colors, we do the best we can with eye-brows (which is a challenge for me; everyone is dressed in "who cares what clothes and hats are making a come-back") Our regular Happy-Hour gatherings now meet in the drive-ways and street so that everyone will be 6 feet apart. We bring our own beverage of choice and talk or shout as needed. Of course reading a good book is great, and time to write to the grands and recieving answers is fun. I think the home schoolers probably find this an exercise. I also find putting my thoughts on paper is a nice outlet. The church programs online are greate, especially during Easter week. This week I am being visited by a female duck who has made a nest next to the house by the garage under the water spicket. I'll have to wait until she goes for her nightly travels to water the plants. I hope she's not a lady of the night but just leaves in the evenings to get food and meet up with other ducks, unless of course they have been quarantined too.
