                <h3>I had a date last night</h3>
                <p>On Thursday I had a phone call from a nice man who had invited me out on a date!! This was after I had lost 2 husbands, 5 and 4 years older than I Even in highschool I had always gone out with guys at least 2 years older than I. 
                    Losing my first husband at age 58 was tough and rather scary. After about 6  years of enjoying tennis, church and girlie events I began going out with a guy I didn't care if I were male or female whcih was ok because he didn't have the qualities I admired in a man even though he did have a good tenor voice and played a mean game of bridge. This ended when I met the man with all the qualities I love and we married 2 years later. He was 69 when he proposed. I told him I would love him forever but would not marry any 70 year old man. That seemed so old at the time. SO we married when he was 69 and we had 19 wonderful years together.
                    From all this you can get a mental picture of my view of age progression. As a young person (in my 30's) I declared that there are 3 stages in aging. 1. youth to 30, 2. middle- 30-75, stage 3. 75 and older, and I wept at each stage change. However now I realize how much you learn at each stage and somehow accept the changes. Those who have not had the experiences cannot understand hwo values and feelings change. I have been asked since childhood "why don't you act your age?" I feel young at heart, enjoy a good laugh and good friends. I evidentally didn't come across to my 65 year old friend as old- she set me up with a date! It was quite exciting looking forward to meeting a tall, gray haired, experienced, understanding gentleman. I did my best to look acceptable for my first date inso many years! Well! at 6 pm the doorbell rang and I answered to meet my 5' 6" tall date. He did have gray hairand a lovely mercedes in which we left under cover of darkness (I was not ready for neighborhood chatter). We had a lovely evening at the Tedddy Abrams concert and chatted getting to know each other. He was very nice but in conversation his age somehow slipped out (mine did not) and that maturity barrier stuck it's head up. He hadn't even finished stage 2. What really makes the difference I cannot explain but I can forever take pleasure in the fact that I am 91 and I had a date last night!
