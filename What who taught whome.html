                <h3>What who taught whome</h3>
                <p>While raising 6 children I have learned a lot! I tried to teach them much but it seems that I am the one being taught by my adult babies!! Here are a few subjects on which I gave my view and tried to pass on to them.
                    Responsibility- One of their jobs was feeding and caring for the dogs, hampsters, fish and other creatures that were brought home. I almost gave up when I helped them set up a stand to give away the hampsters that had multiplied plentily. I left them while I did some errands only find out upon my return that the only hampster they had gotten rid of was the mother of them all. It's hard to explain how this made me feel.
                    On the subject of resourcefulness we seldom had all the ingrediants we needed for a recipe. In spite of or maybe because of this they have all become rather good cooks. They really learned more on their own and now introduce me to foods I have never heard of before. They take me to dinner or have me to their homes and do a better job than I ever did but they did learn to have balanced, healthy meals and sometimes well presented.
                    On the subject matter of character- Honesty came first which they seemed to understand and abide by when it came to other peoples possesions but I do have concerns about how much of the truth was always told.
                    Sportsmanship was emphasized. Being a sports lover myself, I could not stand to hear demeaning cheers or statements about other peoples ability. I think they did alright with this at least when I was around.
                    Love was something has always been shared generously and still is most of the time. It warms my heart to see so much passed on to the grandbabies and great ones! And I mean demonstrative love- hugs, etc.
                    Generosity was taught by baking cakes for birthday friends and helping others. This was always reciprocated so generously that this process did have to verbalized. My children do more for others than I ever had time to do. They make me proud.
                    Dress codes were a challenge in my day. The girls wore dresses wutg hems below the kneww. The boys wore shirts with collars (that needed ironing. That tells you how old I am). Now everyone wears pants, short and long. I was fortunate while raising my boys though. DO you remember the term "high waters"? Well the boys grew so fast and tall that much of the time they were in the right style! Long hair for boys saved us a barber shop spending- They were so stylish! The girls slowly transitioned from pretty little dresses to pants and eventually genes.
                    We taught them a bit about finances. They learned to write a check,balance the checkbook, not to borrow- "Do not spend what you cannot afford". Well you can see how much that helped. Now they are trying, yes trying to teach this old gal how to deal with technology- who has checks anymore? We taught them to drive. Now I have no idea what half the nobs in the car are for butthe children keep trying to teach me. God bless their souls! I hope they live long enough to enjoy the lessons their children have to teach them.
