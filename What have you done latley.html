                <h3>What have you done lately?</h3>
                <p>The obvious answer could be "nothing". Seeing and being with no one, not even family, can be lonely and hard to deal with, especially if you are basically a "people person". However there's always something to learn in every situation. The coronavirushad made it possible for me to enjoy some quiet time. The TV has been boring so thats off, the sadoku and bridge hands in the newspaper remain challenging and I have had time to work on them. Recovering from my January hip replacement operation has presented a challenge that must be worked on every day. I now know how you don't heal as quickly as you do in your 60's, plus having a bit of arthritus makes the going tough, BUT I have time now to deal with it all now without missing anything my social life would have had to offer. Mentally, that's very good and the healing should progress. At last I am feeling better so I have scrubbed the kitchen and bathroom floors, dusted lamps, shades and bulbs, written letters to great grandchildren, learned to operate, to some extent, my newly purchased I-pad so I can now see and talk to my family members.Face time makes it feel like a real visit. Today I have finally begun shredding old papers which hashould have been done years ago, gotten out old flower pots to be given awaym washed the patio furniture, watered the plants and still have time to take a walk. On wednesdays we used to have "Happy hour" for the neighborhood at the church homr; now we go to the end of a neighbors driveway and shout at each other. I have prepared my book report for whenever our book club meets again and have ordered one for the following month. Thats another thing I have learned- how to shop on the internet- that could be good or bad. AnywayI really don;t mind getting a few more winks in the morning plus maybe an afternoon nap or having the Sunday church service on the I-pad in my PJ's with a cup of coffee. For now I have time for healing, cleaning and growing, reminiscing, writing and reading. Maybe this is just what I needed.
