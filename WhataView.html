                <h3>What a View</h3>
                <p>The title brings back many lovely thoughts and memories. The earliest being my summer at Sullivans Island which is about 20 minutes from my family home in Charleston, SC. This short distance made it possible to move to the beach as soon as school was out and did not interfere (too much) with my fathers work in town. Jun was such a wonderful month! School let out, sometimes on my birthday (June 2nd), the sun was warm bu t not incredibly hot yet, the wter temperature was just right and the crab and shrimp were plentiful. What I loved most was walking on the beach to the jedies where the large rocks rested on the waters edge and slid into the ocean. Late afternoon, then dusk, the darkness really touched my senses. The descending sun lit the sky in so many different ways, the clouds made assorted formations and set the scene for so many thoughts, dreams and situations to be contemplated. Then there were stormy, windy rainy and cool days at which times I donned my jeans and sweatshirts, sometimes even a jacket, to walk the beach and feel natures power blowing my hair and sending sand into every crevis and wrinkle of my clothes. One would have to walk against the wind when first going out so that when you turned for home good and tired, it was an easy, fast ride home. The last time I was there with my family God really put on a show for us. One night at about 10 pm, we saw the sky light up way out in the distance across the water. There was sheet lightning pierced with fork lightning showing many different colored clouds dancing in and out of the lit-up sky. We could not stop watching thinking it would all end momentarily but it went on for at least 2 hours. By then I was tired and went to bed so I am not really sure how long this glorious display continued. The next day there was a double rainbow displaying vivid blue, green, red, pink, purple, yellow, and orange colors coming out of the water, across the sky and back into the ocean. In all my yearsI had never been treated to such natural beauty. There is so much sky and water at the beach that I never tire of watching the beautiful views. Perhaps those were Gods gifts to me since I will probably not be able to return to my favorite spot on earth again in this lifetime- what a gift!
