                <h3>Scouting</h3>
                <p>My scouting experiences were fun and broadening!! It began with my twin boys in cub scouts. We lived behind the grammar school so right after the bell rang about 8 little fellows would coome running to our back door for whatever the kitchen had to offerbefore deciding which badge we should work on today. At this age level we were confined to the locality- no trips, thank goodness!! I don't remember that we accomplished much but they did have fun playing and having a goal to work toward. Of course they all learned the Boy Scout Pledge as well as Allegience to the flag.
                    My next scouting experience was with my Jr. and Sr. girl scouts- I had one of each age. The range in ability and experiencewas vast to say the least. One girl was small, studious, and wore what they termed as "coke glasses"- very thick. I don't believe she had many friends, fun or experiences in her short lifetime- that would change! Severl other girls would sneek out of meetings to be with boys. The most sophisticated scout was a true "Sarah Berndhardt"- an actress to the core. All of my girls made up a fascinating array of humanity, physically, socially and mentally. It was challenging but fun taking them camping (the boys were camping across the river one time which really kept us on our toes). Thank heavens for my co-leader who was the other side of the coin from me. We needed each other. She kept the order even when we locked the foodin the car and couldn't find the key. I taught them to swim, even my little shy one whom weall cheered on. I'm sorry to say her glasses fell into the fast moving, deep water never to be recovered during our canoe trip down the Brandywine in Wilmington, DE, which by th way is "The  Old Mill Stream" in the song. We did of course work onbadges while learning how to treat one another and have fun together.
                    When our family moved to Charlotte, NC, the girls made and wrote so many sweet remembrances for me which sent me off with gratitude for having such a fullfilling experience.
