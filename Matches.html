                <h3>Matches</h3>
                <p>Do you ever wonder why two people look exactly alike? It's really remarkable that we all have such different features. For instance, hair; some have blonde, some red, some couburn, some bright red, some black, some brown and of course the lovely grey and white hair which you have yet to earn- we call it our crowning glory. Of course all of this can be changed but I'm talking about what God gave us. Then theres curly, straight, wavy and all of which can and usually is achieved by the owner. My challenge is that it all grows un one direction so one side is ok while thingsmust be done to the otherside to make it look like it belongs to the same person.
                    Next consider foreheads- they come in different sizes but hair covering or exposing can help here. Now eyebrows are to be dealt with. You'll see bushy ones and use pencil-painting on bare skin ones. Perhaps one eyebrow will have a nice arch while it's mate goes straight across. You could spend hours practicing raising the straight one so they look alike but who has that kind of time? Theres a little place on Shelby Street called Dollface that can take care of almost any problem in this category. They can dye eye lashes and brows, they can even permenant the lashes. They gaurantee this to last about weeks- not very long in my book but you do look pretty good for a while.
                    Then theres the eyes!! They express so much emotion and feellings but do tey look alike? Not usually. One can be squinty while the other is wide and round, some actually close when the owner laughs. Of course they come in many colors and hues and usually match although I went to camp with a girl that had one blue eye and one purple eye. I always found myself looking straight at her conversing.
                    Next come noses. This feature comes in so many sorted designes that all cannot be verbalized. I do wonder though how many people have matching nostrils.
                    The mouth usually goes with the eyes in expressions. We're saddened by turned down mouths, happy with smiles, the bigger the better and you can see concentration in the straight across ones. This coordinates well with the eyes. But mouths can turn up on one side and down on the other hile the lips can be straight or curled showing teeth. Mouths also show expressions such as shock or suprise.
                    With all of thisto work with it must be hard to match up allthe parts to make people able to recognize eachother. It reminds me of my Da (nurse maid) in Charleston. When sorting socks, she would pick up one and study the color, size and weave then reach into thepile and pick up any other one and put them together.
                    I must say putting socks and faces together when they match can be quite lovely. Gods angels must have that job but I hope Da's job and heavenly abilities lie elsewhere.
