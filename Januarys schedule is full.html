            <h3>Januarys Schedule is full</h3>
            <div id="welcome">
                <p>This year I have used the first of month of a new decade to do what Janet always said had to happen after age 50- patch, patch, patch. Well she was right on target!
                    About the middle of last year I began to wonder why the picture onthe .V. was not clearer. I could hardly even read the printed titles. What was the matter with those people running these machines, but then maybe it was the TV aging, after all it has been bright and dependable for well over 10 years. I guessed it must be time to replace it. Then I noticed on my calender that it was time for my annual vision check up- you canguess rest of that story. My annual bifoculs arrived in January. Behold, my TV still looks great and I can read the print from my good old recliner at the other end of the room. Both of my husbands would have laughed when I reasoned that I broke even financially on that deal. My glasses cost almost as much as a new TV. My next patch job was when the dermatologist unformed me that a spot on my neck needed to be removed. Well that didn't sound too bad so I scheduled the removal hoping it wouldheal well and quickly because the orthapedist said I could walk without pain in my hip if I replaced the damaged joint so ehy not fill up Jan. Then I would have the rest of the year to enjoy good health. This was my plan, now if it would just fit in with God's plan all my patching should be completed early this year. I think of my childhood patch doll that I loved. She must be well over 100 by now. I think I'll go for it too.
