Repository for my Code Louisville Project

Hello! Welcome to my project, "Mimi's Memories and Musings". I created this as a tribute o my grandmother who recently wrote many stories and gifted them to our family. They are not all added, but if you would like to read one, feel free to take a look at "What a View".

As for the requirements, please see below.

CSS Requirement 1: Hamburger Menu- I created a hamburger menu that will be displayed on mobile screens. When the screen size is lower than 700 px, there will be a hambugr menu for the main menu in the header.

CSS Requirement 2: Flex-Box- I used flex-box to style the body of each page. It is a responsive layout that will format the story and picture from one column to two based on the users screen size.

CSS back-up Requirement 3: Nth-Child- I used the nth:child the target every other story name in the list under the word "Stories". Right now, theyre simply just different colors but I plan to add another type of style to that.

JS Requirement: Comment section- At the bottom of each page in my website, there is a section where the reader can add comments. There are two inputs, one for their name, which will be entered with a colon and a space, then their comment following immediatly after.

Media Query 1: There is a media query on the main menu in the header that allows the spacing of the menu to match the size of the screen. For page min 1000px, it will be in 2 columns, for page min 700 px, it will be in 1 column, and anything less then that will be a hamburger menu.

Media Query 2: There is also a media query on the list of story names on each page. For page min 1000px, it will be in 4 columns, for page-min 700px, it will be in 2 columns, and anything less will be in 1.
