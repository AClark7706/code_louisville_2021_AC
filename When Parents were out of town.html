                <h3>When parents were out of town</h3>
                <p>I have written before about my naivete. My thoughts about my children were mostly good and trusting so my husband and I decided to leave for a nice weekend by ourselves. Every couple with children need to do this occasionally to remember exactly who their spouse is. After all, we do get wrapped up in our many daily chores such as raising those questionable creatures we so joyfully produced about 10 to 17 years ago. What happened? Have they forgotten all the loving, giving and trusting they had been taught? Anyway, we left to enjoy our get-away weekend. We hardly spoke to each other with our hands full of apprehension and worry- Finally Bill expressed his thoughts by saying "Do you think the party has started yet?" How could he think this way? About those 6 little darlings? We discussed going back but decided against showing our lack of trust so on we went. We had a great time and I suppose they did too. When we returned they all looked pretty tired and everything was a little too straight along with other clues which we did not share. However they did have a scare the second night we were gone.Our oldest (pretty big guy) was out of town. He had always been my "fix-it and take care of the situation" guy since my husband was out of town during the week. The girls heard some action going on under the house; we had no basement. There was a sort of half door outside to get under the house which was always kept closed. After much discussion my daughters tip-toed out of the house to see if they could see what was causing the disturbance and found the door open! So they ran to it and closed it. They heard no more but they were scared to pieces. The next day they found the door open again so they knew someone had been under the house- now they were even more frightened. We never did find out what had caused thecomotion but I think they did find out that the parents have a ratherstabilizing presence they now appreciated. They didn't want to stay by themselves again anytime soon, even if they did have to have parents aroundfor their parties. No repremand needed.
