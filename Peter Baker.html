                <h3>Peter Baker</h3>
                <p>Today I have been inspired by the wiggly-worm little creature, otherwise known as a 3 pound baby dog, to write about. My neighbor knows of whom I speak. The first one we had in our family when I was young. My mother did not want any pets ut my father, being a medical doctor, was paid in many ways. One day after a hard days work he came home and quietly shoved a dog in the front door and a cat through the back while absolutley delighted the children of the family and horrified my mother. She adjusted after making us promise to take care of them; we named them Peter and Percy. Well Percy seemed to be nice considering she was a cat with a mind of her own. One day while we were getting ready for a trip to the beach and claiming our seats and who was to hold which animal, I ended up in the "rumble" seat, which of course had low sides and no roof. As soon as my father started the car Percy became frightened, gave me a large scratch and was gone never to be found again. Peter seemed fine with the outcome and off to the beach we went.
                    Now Peter Bsker was not a handsome fox terrior,he was all white with one black ear, but he did have a rather happy and loving personality. He could do some tricksand mother was the only one that he would laugh for- really his lips would curl up and show his teeth. Much to the delight of us all. He loved not only us but he had his eye on the little white poodle who was owned by what we called then a spinster. She delighted in caring for her little girl dog who wore ribbons in her hair which Peter admired so naturally he would go for visits at which the nice old lady would call the pound who would come pick up Peter to fence him in. They didn't know him who easily scaled the fence and came home. This seem to happen on a rather regular basis which gave us many laughs and I'm sure distressed our neighbor, who was a very nice lady.
                    As the old saying goes: "Ain't life grand??!" I wish we could her that phrase more often these.
