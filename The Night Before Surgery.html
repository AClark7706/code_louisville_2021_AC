                <h3>The Night Before Surgery</h3>
                <p>With fear and trepidation I was anticipating the replacement of my poor, old worn out hip hoping to eliminate future discomfort. After all I wasn't going to get any younger (92 now). Sunday before surgery on monday one of the fiure below was attached to each bulletin in church. I knew what it said but as hard as I tried I could not see it for myself. My son and his wife were with me that night and once again I tried to see what was there. It still did not register with me. However monday morning before leaving for the hospital, Bang! There it was clear as a bell which I enthusiastically announced- I see it! This was followed by a loud announcement from my dear daughter (in-law) Wendy- "Alleluia, she's found Jesus"!! Then we knew everything would go well and it has.
